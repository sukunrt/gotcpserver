Effect of batch size on read write speeds

1. Batch size should influence system calls
    - how much time to read 10 mb data depending on batch sizes
    - how much time to write 10 mb data depending on batch sizes
2. the piping system to move data between two separate half connections is as slow as a 
   read write system.
